      The Story Machine framework is designed to be a powerful, extensible
      framework for declaring narrative structures that can be used in games.
      The framework is based on a common AI abstraction: the Behavior Tree.

            In relatively simple terms, a Behavior Tree is a tree graph
            structure made up of individual data points called nodes. Each node
            may have zero or more children, which in turn may also have
            children.
          </PassageText>
          <PassageText>
            Nodes without children are called "Leaf Nodes" and represent
            commands that are run when the runtime reaches that node while
            traversing the tree.
          </PassageText>
          <PassageText>
            Nodes with children have different names based on how many children
            they expect. "Decorator Nodes" only support a single child node;
            whereas "Composite Nodes" support one or more children. Each
            Decorator and Composite node contains the instructions for which
            children should be run at any given time.
          </PassageText>
          <PassageText>
            A `&lt;Sequence&gt;` Composite Node, for example, runs each child node in order
            until one of its children fails to execute OR it successfully
            executes every child node.
          </PassageText>
          <PassageText>
            Meanwhile, a `&lt;Fallback&gt; Node runs each child node in order
            until one of its children succeeds in execution OR it fails to
            execute every child node.
          </PassageText>
          <PassageText>
            Behavior Trees handle timing in discrete steps called "ticks". A
            tick does not have any explicit meaning. It could be an explicit
            interval of time (e.g. every 16ms). It could also be an event-driven
            interval (e.g. only tick when the user interacts with the system). A
            single tick of a Behavior Tree results in traversal of the tree
            until the root node completes its execution with one of three
            statuses: Success, Failure, or Running.
          </PassageText>
          <PassageText>
            These relatively simple abstractions can be combined to produce
            highly sophisticated sets of behavior. Thanks to the recursive
            nature of tree structures, they also lend themselves to modularity
            which makes them easy to share between projects/programs.

    The Story Machine framework provides a set of pre-defined behavior trees
    (referred to here as "elements") that can be used to construct complex
    graphs for narrative games.
  </PassageText>
  <PassageText>
    The `&lt;Passage&gt;` element is the container for a single decision point.
    Adding a `&lt;Text&gt;` element with text inside will add that text
    to the output, which a presentation layer can display.
  </PassageText>
  <PassageText>
    The `&lt;Choices&gt;` element can be added to a Passage to provide a list of
    choices that can be displayed by a presentation layer.
  </PassageText>
  <PassageText>
    Inside of a Choices element, you can add a &lt;Choice&gt; element that
    represents an individual choice. Inside of the Choice element, you can add
    the text for the choice using the `&lt;Text&gt;` element.
  </PassageText>
  <PassageText>
    If you include an element that isn't related to choices as a child of a
    Choice element (like a Passage element), the tree will run that child
    element if and only if the choice is picked by the player.
  </PassageText>
  <Passage>
    <Text>
      For example, selecting one of the choices provided will result in the running of its child nodes:
    </Text>
    <Choices>
      <Choice>
        <Text>
          Pick me to see something basic
        </Text>
        <PassageText>Hello, world!</PassageText>
      </Choice>
      <Choice>
        <Text>
          Pick me to learn the secret of life, the universe, and everything
        </Text>
        <PassageText>42</PassageText>
      </Choice>
    </Choices>
  </Passage>
  <PassageText>
    The `&lt;PassageText&gt;` element is equivalent to the Passage-Text
    combination. It was added to make it easier to write text where Choices are
    not needed.
  </PassageText>
  <PassageText>
    By mixing and matching these abstractions (and maybe building some of your
    own), it is possible to construct highly complex narrative structures in a
    relatively simple way.
