# Story Machines

This library provides a set of behavior tree-based abstractions and a runtime for creating Interactive Fiction. The project is still very much a work-in-progress.

To see an example of a functioning Story Machine game, download the code and run the following commands in a command line:

[Requires Node.js and NPM to run](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the test file
npm run cli -- test.xml
```
